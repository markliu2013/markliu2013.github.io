			<h2>Delegation and Feedback</h2>
			<hr class="dashed" />
			<p class="highlight">Effective delegation practices means a more efficient, stable and happy workplace</p>
			<p>How work is delegated and how it is supervised are critical factors in any business. Our training is informed by 15 years experience working at all levels of management in this often challenging area. Good delegation is the enabling device for any successful leveraged business model and the foundation for a culture of learning. This course has been designed specifically for managers and is mindful of the pressures and difficulties of sustaining a profitable business.</p>
			<p>Course participants are challenged to critically analyse their own delegation and feedback practices and are provided with tools to work in a more effective and planned manner.</p>
