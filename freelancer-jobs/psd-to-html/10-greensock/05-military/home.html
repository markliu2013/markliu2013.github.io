			War sees rapid advancement in everything from medical techniques to aviation technology, and seemingly all things in between. When the war is ended, however, these advancements in technology don’t simply sit on the shelf. More often than not they find their way into everyday applications in modern life. A great example of this are the vehicles that are produced for war, such as the iconic Jeep, the well-known humvee, and the hardworking armored vehicle.

			<h2>The Armored Car</h2>
			<hr />
			<p class="big">The armored car that we are familiar with today has its origins in a basic concept put forward by the famed inventor and artist Leonardo Da Vinci, and has since been built upon.</p>
			<p>By the late 19th century armored cars were appearing. The goal behind the creation of the armored car was to create a vehicle that would enable the rapid deployment of machine-guns to crucial points on the field of battle. It was also hoped that the newly created armored cars would be able to take the place of cavalry, and help increase a unit’s weight of fire. The first of these vehicles, however, offered little in the way of protection for the crews which were operating them, and brought almost nothing to the battlefield in the sense of firepower. In addition to this lack of firepower and physical protection for the crews, the first armored cars were not fast enough to compete with the speed and mobility of the calvary. By the beginning of the twentieth century, though, developments and improvements in automobile engines allowed for the creation of functioning and effective armored cars.</p>

					<p><strong>In 1911 armored cars first saw combat in the Italio-Turkish war</strong>, and they would then later see limited combat in the First World War where they were increasingly used as anti-aircraft platforms as air power surged forward. In addition to their use as anti-aircraft weapons, the armored cars served as protection for high ranking officers as they made their way to various points on the fields of battle.</p>

					<p>Perhaps <strong>the first transition that was made with the armored car from the battlefield to the civilian world occurred in 1930.</strong> The Mercedes Benz Company, following in the footsteps of the Rolls Royce Company which had produced armored vehicles for the Triple Entente’s war effort against Germany and the Central Allies during the First World War, built the Nurburg 460. The Nurburg 460 was specifically designed and created to protect Pope Pius XI.</p>

					<p id="the-armored-car21" class="animation">Armored vehicles continued to be part of the arsenal of modern and modernizing armies as the world edged closer to the Second World War. During World War II the United States of America mass produced the M8 Greyhound, a light armored car equipped with a 37 mm gun. Originally the Greyhound was designed as an anti-tank vehicle, but the armor of the various German tanks proved to be too heavy, and instead the Greyhound was pressed into service as both a reconnaissance vehicle and as an infantry support vehicle. The Greyhound was mass produced and used extensively by both the United States and by the British, seeing action in both the European and Middle Eastern theaters of the war.</p>

				<p>Today the world is no stranger to the idea of an armored vehicle. <strong>Armored vehicles are used to protect celebrities, politicians, and heads of state as well as to protect the transfer of money between financial institutions.</strong> On any given day armored cars can be seen transporting money from retail businesses to banks. In addition to these two types of armored vehicles people may be aware, at least through the news media, of police armored cars. The armored cars and vehicles employed by the police -- most recently during the massive manhunt following the Boston Marathon bombing -- are more in line with the original armored vehicles that prowled the fields of battle. The police armored vehicles are designed to be fast moving and heavily armored, capable of delivering well trained and armed police officers to dangerous situations.</p>

The only part of the vehicle which was not part of the Bantam inventory was the design for the four-wheel drive components which were custom, and had had to be ordered through Spicer automotive.</p>
					<p class="last">The prototype Bantam Reconnaissance Car was assembled, by hand, in Butler, Pennsylvania. The vehicle was then driven to Camp Holabird in Maryland for September 21st, 1940, where the testing phase was initiated.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately for the American Bantam Car Company the United States Army did not feel that the company was sufficiently large enough to produce the vehicle in the numbers that the Army believed that it was going to need should they become engaged in hostilities. <strong>In order to see if the Bantam Reconnaissance Car could be built in sufficient numbers, the Army sent the designs for the Bantam to two other companies, the Willys-Overland Company and the Ford Automotive Company.</strong></p>

While the American Bantam Car Company did not provide their vehicle for the upcoming war effort, the company did build heavy-duty trailers for the military during the Second World War.</p>

			<p class="not-last">The Hummer that can be found in the car lots of America is based on the military Humvee, a vehicle that has seen a large amount of usage from the American military for over forty years.</p>
			<p><strong>The Humvee was created out of the United States’ need for a vehicle to replace the aging trucks and Jeeps of the country’s military motor pool.</strong> Not only was a vehicle needed to replace those that were already in stock, but the new vehicle needed to meet the demands of a modern battlefield, and to plan for future combat missions and excursions as well.</p>

					<p id="the-hummer08" class="animation">The concept of a motorized unit was quickly scrapped, though, and the Humvee quickly became the core of the United States’ military vehicles. Commanders no longer showed up in Jeeps, but in Humvees. Reconnaissance units no longer went out in Jeeps, but in Humvees. Humvees were adaptable not only for command or combat purposes, but they could be up-armored and equipped with a wide range of weapons (the M60 machine gun, the M240 machine gun, the .50 caliber machine gun, and the MK19 grenade launcher). In addition to their combat use for active offense and defense, the Humvee was also adapted to serve as combat ambulances to retrieve the dead and wounded. Currently, in the United States military alone, there are seventeen different types of Humvees, ranging in type from mobile ambulances to rocket launchers. The most effective model at the present time, though, is the M1151, which is allowing the United States military to streamline repairs and replacement parts.</p>

					<p><strong>The Humvee first saw combat in the invasion of Panama in 1989,</strong> in what was known as Operation Just Cause, and has seen action -- and continues to see action -- ever since. Humvees continue to be deployed in Iraq and in Afghanistan. Not only is the Humvee a mainstay of the American military, but it is in heavy use in a wide array of other countries’ militaries as well.</p>

			<p class="first">The first Humvees that appeared on American roads, independent of the military, were decommissioned military Humvees purchased by military enthusiasts. The popularity of the vehicle, and the familiarity of the American people with the Humvee following the First Gulf War, inspired AM General to <strong>produce and release the Hummer H1 in 1992,</strong> a civilian version of the Humvee.</p>

			<p class="second last">The H1 and H2 versions of the Hummer were extremely large vehicles, causing difficulties not only in parking and driving, but in fuel economy and in accidents on the road. The Hummer H3 quickly followed with the H3 model being smaller, more affordable and economical version of the H1 and H2. While <strong>production of the Hummer line officially ceased in 2010,</strong> the vehicles can still be seen on the road today, as can their predecessor, the military grade Humvee.</p>

			It should come as no surprise that certain military vehicles have made the jump from the field of battle to the streets of the United States of America

		<hr />
		<p>Since the Second World War America has been in a state of military preparedness should the Cold War with the former Soviet Union break out into an actual shooting war between the two major players. Hundreds of thousands of American men and women have served in the various branches of the United States’ military, and many of them bonded -- as only Americans can -- to the vehicles which they drove in their youth. In addition to this Americans pride themselves on a sense of independence, and both the Jeep and the Humvee are symbols of this.</p>

			<p id="military-vehicles05" class="animation italic-text">Regardless as to the specific reasons why they made the jump, the Jeep, the Humvee, and the armored car are all excellent examples of military vehicles making a successful transition from military to civilian life.</p>
			<div id="military-vehicles06" class="sprite-line-dot01 animation"></div>
		</div>
		<p>The Jeep and the Humvee, then, have been able to grow in American society as cultural representations of independence and strength, while the armored car has taken on a more practical role. Armored cars, though they had their military genesis in the late 19th century, still serve to protect the financial and physical well-being of the people. Financially this is done as money and high end merchandise are transported from one facility to another, and physically when a direct threat is presented by criminals or terrorists.</p>
