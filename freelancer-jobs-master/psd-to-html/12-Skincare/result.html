			<h3>How does it work?</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<h4>How do i get free skin creams?</h4>
			<p>Did you know that many companies give away free samples of their products for people to try? How many you times have seen a beauty product, perfume, or aftershave in Boots, Superdrug, or any other highstreet store that is free for you to try? Have you ever seen a cosmetics or beauty product stand set-up in your local shopping centre offering Free trials? Companies want as many people to try their products as possible to show how good they are.</p>
			<p>Feel Beautiful has access to a wide range of companies and sends you the product which is best for you to try for free!</p>
			<hr />
			<h4>Is it really free?</h4>
			<p>Yes, you will really receive products free of charge to try. Some companies require you to pay a shipping/postage cost, this will be clearly displayed before you accept and is usually only three or four pounds.</p>
			<hr />
			<h4>I'm not sure, whats the catch?</h4>
			<p>There is no catch; these are full beauty products available to you to try for free. Often these products are only available in limited quantities and we can only reserve your application for a short time so apply now!</p>
			<hr />
			<h4>Is it safe?</h4>
			<p>Yes, totally. All the products you receive are already for sale in many highstreet shops. Testing a product only means that you have received a free sample.</p>
