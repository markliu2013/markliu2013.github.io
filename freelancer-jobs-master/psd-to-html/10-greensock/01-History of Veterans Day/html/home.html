			<div id="sec09-02" class="animation red">Conclusion: How to Help a Veteran Today</div>
			<div class="box">Based on the statistics listed above, young, single veterans returning from war may need the most help of all. One effective way to help a veteran succeed after service is by providing them with the support they need to attend and graduate college as they transition back into civilian life.</div>
		</div><!--end cols-1 -->

				<div id="sec09-04" class="animation red-banner02">Veterans that attend college need support from other veterans</div>
			</div>
			<p class="first">The good news is that a number of colleges and universities are advertising more <strong class="red">"veteran-friendly"</strong> classes, programs, and degrees than ever before. The United States government has set aside billions of dollars in the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill for this exact purpose.</p>
			<p class="last">But not so fast… Many colleges and universities are aggressively recruiting veterans to take advantage of federal funds. Veterans that sign up for school without both eyes open may not be fully equipped with the skills they need to compete academically and relate to other students in a college setting.</p>
		</div><!--end cols-2 -->
		<div class="cols-3">
			<img id="sec09-05" class="animation" src="images/section09-img-04.png" width="190" height="190" alt="" />
			<p>It is for this reason that a number of veteran-friendly universities are now opening veteran centers.<strong>These centers are designed to offer veteran students a support base where they can meet other veterans and take advantage of resources that may include personal and career counseling.</strong></p>
		</div><!--end cols-3 -->
		<div class="cols-4">
			<p class="row1">Collegiate success for a veteran is entirely possible with the right expectations and support system in place. A veteran student preparing for college can heed the following guidelines:</p>
			<div class="animation-holder animation-holder1">
				<div id="sec09-06" class="animation red-banner02">Expect a bumpy transition</div>
				<div id="sec09-07" class="animation red-banner02">Connect with other veterans</div>
				<img id="sec09-08" class="animation" src="images/section09-img-05.png" width="139" height="274" alt="" />
				<p class="text1">No veteran is going to transition seamlessly into a completely new atmosphere, especially on a college campus. To set yourself up for success as a veteran, it helps to prepare for a major transition that may not come easy to you. Consider college to be a new world that you must embrace. While the change may be difficult at first, it will begin to feel more natural as you relate to fellow veteran students and make new friends.</p>
				<img id="sec09-09" class="animation" src="images/section09-img-06.png" width="203" height="270" alt="" />
				<p class="text2">Speaking of veteran friends, it's important to look for veteran-centered programs on a new college campus. If you have enrolled in a veteran-friendly college, as mentioned above, you may be able to take advantage of a number of programs that encourage socialization with other veteran students. If your school doesn't have any such resources, consider connecting with other young veterans at a local VFW or in an online support group. Any type of encouragement during a time of transition helps.</p>

			<div class="animation-holder animation-holder2">
				<img id="sec09-10" class="animation" src="images/section09-img-07.png" width="131" height="259" alt="" />
				<div id="sec09-11" class="animation red-banner02">Open your mind to civilian relationships</div>
				<p class="text1">Even though it's critical to reach out to other veterans during a time of transition, don't forget about making civilian connections as well. Step outside of your veteran bubble from time to time to join student organizations that strike your interest. Take civilian students up on their offers to socialize, no matter how intimidated you may feel at first. It will get easier and easier with each invitation.</p>
				<div id="sec09-12" class="animation">
					<p>If you have a veteran in your family that is transitioning back to civilian life, reading the tips listed above can help you understand where they're coming from.</p>
					<p class="red last">A major transition from military service into the "real world" is never easy, no matter how prepared a veteran may seem.</p>

					<p>Asking a friend or family member returning home from warhow you can help may be help enough.A veteran that feels isolated and overwhelmed may simply need a friend to listen. A veteran with serious physical or psychological injuries may need help around the house or rides to and from physical therapy appointments. Remain flexible, open, and willing as you offer your support to a veteran in your life.</p>

				<div id="sec09-15" class="animation">PTSD</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p><strong>If you know a veteran that suffers from PTSD, counseling for both parties may be in order.</strong></p>
					<p class="last">You may not have the skills to support a spouse, sibling, parent, or friend with PTSD. A veteran with PTSD returning from war often struggles to trust those closest to them. They will need to work through emotions and traumatic memories in a safe setting, such as with a therapist or counselor. You may also benefit from counseling to better understand what it is like to have PTSD and learn tools that you can use to help.</p>
