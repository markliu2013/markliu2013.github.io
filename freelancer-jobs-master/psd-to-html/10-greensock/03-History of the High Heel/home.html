				<p>You heard that right - the first instances of high heel wearing were recorded in early Egypt in 3500 BC. Around that time, depictions of high heel shoes could be seen etched in murals on Egyptian temples and tombs.</p>

Soon enough, women's high heels grew more slender and feminine to separate them from men's stacked high heel shoes.

				<p>By the time that the 21st Century rolled around, it was no longer shameful to suffer from a "high heel fetish", thanks to popular shows like <strong>Sex and the City.</strong> High heels were finally celebrated as a fun fashion statement and must-have accessory for all women</p>
				<p class="last">The new millennium also brought with it a high heel health breakthrough for women. By now, women had heard more than enough about how high heels were bad for the health of the feet and back. But one 2008 study pointed out that wearing high heels regularly could actually improve muscle tone in a woman's pelvic floor to ease urinary incontinence.<sup>6</sup></p>

				<p>While hardly practical in real life, who are we to judge such an inventive high heel design that could become the cultural norm in just a few centuries? If you think back to the first sky-high "Louie" heel introduced at 5 inches tall, it was likely to have been a shocker that rocked the country the first time it was worn out in public.</p>

				<p>If we can take any cues from these fashion obsessed celebs, it is that high heels are here to stay. High heels have been worn in some form or another throughout the length of history. In modern times, high heels are still celebrated as a fun, flirty, and often dangerous fashion accessory.</p>
				<p class="last">Since high heels have a tendency to wreak havoc on your feet when worn for decades, alternating the style of heel you wear can protect your precious tootsies. This may mean wearing ballet flats one day, kitten heels the next, and stilettos the rest of the week. At the end of a long day, you can give your feet a break and some much-needed TLC with a foot bath, massage, and pedicure.</p>
