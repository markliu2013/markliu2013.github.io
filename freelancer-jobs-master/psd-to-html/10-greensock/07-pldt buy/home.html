				<p>Unfortunately, in a state like Michigan where PLPD is most prevalent, insurance rates are recognized as some of the highest in the country.3 Michigan was ranked by Insure.com as the second most expensive state for car insurance on a 2013 vehicle. Granted, PLPD insurance is likely to be cheaper than full coverage insurance for a brand-new car.</p>

					<p><strong>If you take the time to focus on being a better driver, it will quickly pay for itself.</strong> Drivers with clean records may pay 10% less on car insurance across-the-board.2 As an added bonus, if you don't cause an accident, you won't need to use your PLPD insurance. Filing a claim can cause insurance rates to skyrocket.</p>

					<p>If you're in the market to upgrade your vehicle, <strong>consider the safety features in the new car</strong> you buy. A safer vehicle will cost less to insure since features like airbags, antilock brakes, and automatic seatbelts are likely to reduce injuries and lower the total expense of an accident. A good credit rating can also be beneficial to keep car insurance rates reasonable.</p>

					<p>Or, this may be a case where the <strong>"squeaky wheel gets the grease."</strong> Many times, all you have to do is ask when it comes to scoring discounts from your insurance agent. You may qualify for defensive driving, professional, or student discounts. You can also consider bundling multiple insurance policies together to lower all premiums - with potential savings of 15%-30% on two or more policies.</p>

					<p>Lastly, <strong>don't make the mistake of overpaying</strong> for insurance coverage. You may be one of the 76% of insured drivers that pays for comprehensive insurance on top of basic liability. Another 71% of drivers also pay for collision coverage in their policy.<sup>2</sup></p>
